# Persistent Actors and Event Sourcing
Sample code that shows how to create a persistent actor and implement event sourcing using `Akka Persistence`. It serves as a complement for the article called [Persistent Actors and Event Sourcing](https://serdeliverance.github.io/blog/blog/persistent-actors/) published on my personal blog.

## Requirements
JDK 8

sbt
## Running the code

`sbt "runMain PersistentActorDemo"`
